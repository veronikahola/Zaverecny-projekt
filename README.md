Kohoutky
Imaginery local farm

This website for an imaginary farm named 'Kohoutky' was created as part of the 'Become a Coder' course at Czechitas. The final project required a multi-page responsive website using flexbox or CSS grid, built on the Eleventy generator, employing BEM, Sass, and Eleventy collections (for news/ blog article). This project was my first experience in independently developing a website from scratch - starting from research and conceptualization, creating low-fidelity and high-fidelity wireframes, developing prototypes, testing, and finally coding the website itself.
